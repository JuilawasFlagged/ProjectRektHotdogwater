<h1>Comic Sans</h1>

<p> Comic Sans is one of the worst fonts in the world, why? Because its overused and usually in the same group of horrible designed websites and essays. It is up there with using Red on Blue or Blue on Red when it comes to background and text color.</p>

<p>In my opinion, if you are using Comic Sans for any reason, make it for humor, because that is what Comic Sans is only useful for..</p>

<p>Most uses for the font for the past few decades where mostly jokes, and horribly designed programs and websites that use the font. To put it simply, it doesn't fit in any type of website. It's on the same level as clippy in annoyance scale.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, some modern websites for actual companies uses comic sans, which confuses me since the choice of font is in no means professional in any way. it confuses me to the point that I am just wondering if they are doing it in a ironic way like the Yale School of Art site does it. Or are they actually that serious.</p>
<p>I believe even the creator of The Worlds Worst Website Ever doesn't even use comic sans.</p>
