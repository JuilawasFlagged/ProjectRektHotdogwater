    <h2>Computers</h2>
    <p>Like I said in the introduction HTML, I've been interested in computers for well... Most of my life. So it isn't really a suprise when I say that I know my stuff, I kinda do. </p>
    
    <h2>DND*</h2>
    <p>Well, the astrisk is there for a reason, since I rarely do DND sessions anymore. I used to DM a few campaigns, the longest lasting one clocked in 16 months. Oh, if you really like MMOs and RPGs, you should really find a place you can play DND, its quite fun if you have the right group.</p>
    
    <h2>Malware Testing</h2>
    <p>Welp, yes, I do commonly do analysis of viruses, malware etc etc. Its pretty fun if you know what you are doing.</p>
    <h3>FAQ (From the years I've done it)</h3>
    
    <h4>Isn't there some Risk to this type of thing?</h4>
    <p>There is no risk, unless you do it wrong. If a sample needs a active connection, I would a seperate connection from my main connection to conduct such thing. Therefore risk of it going and lets say, infecting any other computer is quite low. Virtual Machines exist for a reason too.</p>
    
    <h4>Is this illegal?</h4>
    <p>Simple answer, <i>no</i> long anwser, <i>it vary</i>, it matters in what way you conduct it, if you are using your own systems and resources, or have <i>expressed permission</i> to do it to someone elses machines, its perfectly legal. There is no danger to said thing.</p>
    
    <h4>So, do you make malware?</h4>
    <p>No? I mean, thats asking a scientist that made a vaccine if they made the pendemic. 9/10 times they don't create the issues themselves.</p>
