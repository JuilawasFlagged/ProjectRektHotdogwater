<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Hello, I am Octoomy (Using nickname for privacy sake), a person from Ohio, been interested in coding and similar since I was 8. Started off with simple scripting from VBS and Batch, then discovering a range of programming languages, those being Python, Golang and Java. To set back further, since the age of 6, I was interested in computers, because of me playing flash games on the website <i>Kongregate</i> and <i>Miniclip</i>. The only game I really remember playing though was Dune Buggy.</p>
